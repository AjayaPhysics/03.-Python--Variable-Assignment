| **Concept**                        | **Explanation**                                                                                     | **Example Code**                                                                                   | **Use Cases**                                                                                                       |

| **Basic Assignment**               | Assigning a value to a variable using the `=` operator.                                             | `x = 5`<br>`y = "Hello"`                                                                           | Used to store values (numbers, strings, etc.) in variables for reuse in programs.                                   |
| **Multiple Assignment**            | Assigning values to multiple variables in a single statement.                                       | `a, b, c = 1, 2, 3`                                                                               | Simplifies assigning multiple variables when values are known upfront.                                              |
| **Chained Assignment**             | Assigning the same value to multiple variables simultaneously.                                       | `x = y = z = 10`                                                                                  | Useful when initializing several variables with the same value, like a default setting.                             |
| **Dynamic Typing**                 | Python allows variables to change their data type during runtime.                                   | `x = 10`<br>`x = "Now I am a string!"`                                                            | Python variables are not statically typed, allowing flexibility for different operations.                           |
| **Swapping Variables**             | Swapping the values of two variables without needing a temporary variable.                          | `x, y = 1, 2`<br>`x, y = y, x`                                                                     | Common in algorithms to rearrange values without requiring an extra variable.                                       |
| **Type Conversion**                | Assigning a value to a variable after converting it to another type.                                | `x = int("5")`<br>`y = float(3)`                                                                  | Converts data from one type to another, essential in data processing or user input handling.                        |
| **Unpacking a List or Tuple**      | Assigning multiple values from a list or tuple to variables in a single statement.                  | `nums = [1, 2, 3]`<br>`a, b, c = nums`                                                            | Splits data into separate variables for easier access. Useful in handling structured data.                          |
| **Global Variables**               | Variables defined outside of functions that can be accessed inside the function using the `global` keyword. | `x = 5`<br>`def change_global():`<br>`  global x`<br>`  x = 10`                                                                         | Enables modifying a global variable inside a function. Used for state management across functions.                  |
| **Constants (by convention)**      | Variables whose values should not change, written in all caps by convention.                        | `PI = 3.14159`<br>`MAX_USERS = 100`                                                               | Used to define values that should remain constant, improving code readability and maintainability.                   |
| **Immutable Assignment**           | Assigning values to immutable types like `tuple` or `frozenset`, which cannot be modified.          | `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`<br>`my_set = frozenset({4, 5, 6})`                                         | Useful when you need data integrity and don't want values to change accidentally.                                   |
| **Mutable Assignment**             | Assigning values to mutable types like `list` or `dict`, which can be modified.                     | `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`<br>`my_dict = {'key': 'value'}`                                             | Allows for data structures that can be updated or extended dynamically, like storing user data.                     |
| **Augmented Assignment**           | Combines an arithmetic or bitwise operation with assignment (e.g., `+=`, `-=`).                     | `x = 5`<br>`x += 3  # Now x is 8`<br>`x *= 2  # Now x is 16`                                      | Saves time and code when performing operations like addition, subtraction, etc., on variables.                      |
| **Conditional Assignment**         | Assigning a value based on a condition using a one-liner.                                           | `x = 10 if condition else 5`                                                                      | Used in scenarios where assignments depend on conditions, simplifying decision-making logic.                         |
| **Default Function Arguments**     | Assigning default values to function parameters.                                                    | `def greet(name="Guest"):`<br>`  print(f"Hello, {name}")`                                         | Allows defining fallback values for function parameters, making the function more flexible and robust.              |
| **Aliased Variables**              | Assigning one variable to another to create an alias (both point to the same memory location for mutable objects). | `list1 = [1, 2, 3]`<br>`list2 = list1`                                                           | Enables referencing the same object with different names, but requires caution to avoid unintended modifications.    |
| **Local Variables**                | Variables declared inside a function, accessible only within the function.                          | `def my_func():`<br>`  x = 10`                                                                    | Used to encapsulate variables within a function scope, improving modularity and avoiding name clashes.               |
| **Read-Only (Frozen)**             | Using `frozenset` or tuples to create read-only assignments.                                         | `frozen = frozenset([1, 2, 3])`                                                                   | Useful in applications requiring data integrity, such as configurations or constant datasets.                        |
| **Annotations (Type Hints)**       | Assigning variables with type hints to indicate the expected type of data (Python 3.5+).            | `x: int = 5`<br>`name: str = "John"`                                                              | Improves code readability and helps with static type checking in development.                                       |
| **Anonymous Variables**            | Using `_` as a throwaway variable name for values you do not need.                                  | `x, _ = (10, 20)`                                                                                 | Useful for ignoring unwanted data in unpacking operations.                                                           |
